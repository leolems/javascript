Javascript - A collection of small projects :)



These are some things I made for various purposes:

1) templates    (xtpl)
    templates is the fastest and smallest javascript template engine on the planet.
    It is based on an idea from John Resig, but is improved and reworked by me.. enjoy :)
    
2) Ascii anmation  (xaa)
    Is a small fun project I made to make little (or big) animations with the use of plain ASCII
    
3) multiselect
    I hate those multiselect elements... they dont work that good, and often users dont get the multiselect part.
    I made a replacement multiselect that replaces the original object with a checkbox variant.
